# Course Site Generator
This was the final project of my CSE 219 (Computer Science III) class, which I took in Fall 2018. 
This is for the use of professors to simplify the process of building course websites. 
The majority of the Course Site Generator Project was built by me, though Richard McKenna (McKillaGorilla) is credited for code that involves the Office Hours Pane. 
The Desktop Java Framework, jTPS, and Properties Manager were all created by Richard McKenna, though I made some edits to the Desktop Java Framework.

To run the Course Site Generator, open the projects in a java IDE and build the projects in the following order: 
Properties Manager
jTPS
Desktop Java Framework
Course Site Generator 

You may need to add references to the jar files. I recommend for each project, reference all the jar files in this repository. For help using this project, just click 'help' on the project. Please do not copy any code from this project if you have the same project assigned for your class. If you do, I am not responsible for any of your academic dishonesty accusations.
